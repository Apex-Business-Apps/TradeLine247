# Sprint Protocol (NO LOOP)
- Make ONE pass through steps; only micro-fix if a step fails.
- Minimal diffs; no refactors; no UI drift; no test changes.
- Idempotent changes only.
- Output format required:
  1) Findings (file/line evidence)
  2) Fix (unified diffs)
  3) Verification commands
  4) Commit messages (1 per step)
- If credentials are missing: STOP and report exactly which env var/group is missing (do not guess).
