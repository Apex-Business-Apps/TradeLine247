# Definition of Done (Double Green Upload)
- Codemagic Android workflow uploads SIGNED .aab to Google Play track=internal.
- Codemagic iOS workflow uploads .ipa to App Store Connect and submits to TestFlight INTERNAL only.
- Artifact guardrail: canonical IPA path/name + glob fallback so filename drift can't break publishing.
- Version rules:
  - Android: versionCode MUST increase each upload (set to 2 now) and keep versionName 1.0.0.
  - iOS: CFBundleVersion (build) MUST be higher/unique per upload (set to 219 now) and keep 1.0.4.
