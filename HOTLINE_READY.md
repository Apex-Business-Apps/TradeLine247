## Phase HS1: Dry-Run Paths ‚úÖ

### Documented Paths
Three call flows have been simulated with mocked requests:

1. **Support Path (DTMF 1)**
   - User presses 1 at IVR menu
   - System generates TwiML redirect to human agent queue
   - Expected outcome: Call routed to support team
   - Dry-run status: ‚úÖ Sequence documented, TwiML mocked

2. **Sales Path (DTMF 2)**
   - User presses 2 at IVR menu
   - System generates TwiML redirect to sales team queue
   - Expected outcome: Call routed to sales
   - Dry-run status: ‚úÖ Sequence documented, TwiML mocked

3. **Timeout ‚Üí AI Voicemail**
   - No DTMF input within 10 seconds
   - System transitions to AI voicemail prompt
   - Expected outcome: Caller leaves message, AI transcribes
   - Dry-run status: ‚úÖ Sequence documented, TwiML mocked

### Verification Points
- [x] Sequence diagrams created for all paths
- [x] Expected TwiML responses documented
- [x] Analytics logging points identified
- [x] No actual network calls made (mocked only)
- [x] Timing estimates provided (3-8 seconds per interaction)

## Webhook Security Validation

### To Be Validated at Implementation Time
The following security measures will be implemented when edge functions are created:

#### Twilio Signature Verification
- **Method:** X-Twilio-Signature header validation
- **Secret:** Twilio Auth Token (from environment)
- **Algorithm:** HMAC-SHA1
- **Implementation:** Edge function entry point
- **Status:** üîí To be validated during HS implementation

#### HTTPS Enforcement
- **Protocol:** TLS 1.2+ required
- **Certificate:** Managed by Supabase Edge Functions
- **Validation:** Automatic via platform
- **Status:** üîí Platform-enforced (no action required)

#### IP Allowlisting (Optional)
- **Source IPs:** Twilio webhook origins
- **Ranges:** To be obtained from Twilio documentation
- **Enforcement:** Supabase firewall rules (if supported)
- **Status:** üîí To be evaluated during implementation

#### Request Authentication
- **API Key:** Supabase anon key for public endpoints
- **Service Role:** For admin/internal calls only
- **JWT:** If user-scoped actions required
- **Status:** üîí To be configured during edge function creation

### Validation Checklist (Pre-Production)
- [ ] X-Twilio-Signature validation enabled and tested
- [ ] HTTPS endpoints verified (no HTTP fallback)
- [ ] IP allowlist configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Request size limits enforced (prevent payload bombs)
- [ ] Rate limiting active (per HS3 plan)
- [ ] Audit logging enabled for all webhook calls

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Create edge functions for IVR menu and consent capture
- Implement Twilio signature verification
- Set up database tables for logging
- Deploy to staging environment

### Phase 2: Call Flows (Week 2)
- Implement Support/Sales routing
- Implement AI voicemail fallback
- Test DTMF handling and timeout behavior
- Verify TwiML generation

### Phase 3: Abuse Protection (Week 3)
- Implement per-ANI rate limiting
- Implement per-IP rate limiting
- Add exponential backoff logic
- Test 429 responses

### Phase 4: Production Prep (Week 4)
- Obtain legal/privacy approvals
- Load testing and performance tuning
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Staged rollout (internal ‚Üí beta ‚Üí public)

## Go/No-Go Criteria

### Required for Production Launch
- [ ] All approvals received (legal, privacy, business)
- [ ] Security validation complete (webhook signatures verified)
- [ ] Consent scripts tested in both languages
- [ ] Rate limiting tested and functional
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured
- [ ] Incident response plan documented
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared

### Nice-to-Have (Can Launch Without)
- [ ] Advanced ML-based anomaly detection
- [ ] Geographic call blocking (international)
- [ ] Real-time dashboard for call queue visibility
- [ ] Automated blacklist updates from threat feeds

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Consent wording rejected by legal | Medium | High | Buffer 1 week for revisions |
| Rate limits too aggressive (false positives) | Medium | Medium | Start conservative, tune based on data |
| Webhook signature validation bug | Low | High | Comprehensive testing, security review |
| High call volume on launch day | Medium | Medium | Staged rollout, capacity monitoring |
| Twilio API downtime | Low | High | Fallback message, email notification |

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise post-launch:
1. **Immediate:** Disable IVR, route all calls to voicemail
2. **Short-term:** Redirect to human answering service
3. **Code rollback:** Revert edge functions to previous version
4. **Communication:** Email/SMS notify customers of temporary service change

## Post-Launch Monitoring

### Key Metrics (First 48 Hours)
- Total call volume
- Consent opt-in rate (% pressing DTMF 1)
- Consent opt-out rate (% pressing DTMF 9)
- Rate limit blocks (count and ANI distribution)
- Average call duration
- Error rate (failed webhooks, timeouts)

### Alert Thresholds
- Error rate > 5%: Page on-call engineer
- Rate limit blocks > 100/hour: Review for false positives
- Consent opt-out rate > 50%: Review script wording
