# Appointment Security Fix - Customer PII Protection

## Issue Resolved
**Critical Security Vulnerability**: Customer appointment data (emails, phone numbers, names) was potentially accessible to unauthorized organization members through overly permissive RLS policies.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. RLS Policy Restructure
- **Removed** all permissive organization member policies that allowed direct access to customer PII
- **Kept** the "Block direct customer data access" policy (USING condition: false)
- **Kept** service role access for edge functions
- **Added** new restricted policy for organization members that blocks PII field access

### 2. Safe Data Access Layer
- **Created** `appointments_safe` view that excludes all PII fields (email, first_name, e164)
- **Provides** boolean flags indicating if contact info exists without exposing it
- **Enabled** security barrier on the view to prevent data leakage

### 3. Audit and Monitoring
- **Added** comprehensive audit trigger for all appointments table access
- **Logs** any direct table access attempts to `data_access_audit`
- **Generates** high-severity security alerts for unauthorized PII access attempts
- **Enhanced** existing secure functions with proper access logging

### 4. Secure Access Functions
The following functions should be used for appointment data access:

#### For Organization Members (Non-PII):
- `get_appointment_summary_secure(org_id, limit)` - Returns appointments without PII
- `appointments_safe` view - Safe view for basic appointment data

#### For Admins Only (With PII):
- `get_org_appointments_secure(org_id, limit)` - Returns masked PII data
- `get_customer_contact_info(appointment_id)` - Full PII access with heavy audit logging
- `emergency_customer_contact(appointment_id, reason)` - Emergency access with justification

## Security Benefits

1. **Zero-Trust PII Access**: Customer data is not accessible through direct queries
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only get the minimum data needed for their role
3. **Complete Audit Trail**: All access attempts are logged and monitored
4. **Automatic Threat Detection**: Unauthorized access attempts trigger security alerts
5. **Role-Based Access Control**: Admins get masked data, emergency functions for unmasked access

## Developer Guidelines

### ✅ Safe Practices
```typescript
// Use safe view for non-PII appointment data
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('appointments_safe')
  .select('*')
  .eq('organization_id', orgId);

// Use secure functions for detailed appointment data
const { data } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_appointment_summary_secure', { org_id: orgId });
```

### ❌ Avoid These Patterns
```typescript
// NEVER query appointments table directly
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('appointments')  // This will be blocked and logged
  .select('*');

// NEVER try to access PII fields directly
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('appointments')
  .select('email, first_name, e164');  // Will trigger security alerts
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### What Gets Logged:
- All direct appointments table access attempts
- PII access attempts with user identification
- Function-based secure access usage

### Alert Triggers:
- Any direct table query containing PII fields
- Excessive data access patterns
- Unauthorized admin function usage

### Review Recommendations:
1. **Weekly**: Review `data_access_audit` for unusual patterns
2. **Daily**: Monitor `security_alerts` for PII access violations
3. **Monthly**: Audit admin access to customer contact functions

## Impact on Existing Code

✅ **No Breaking Changes**: 
- Existing dashboard uses mock data (not affected)
- All secure functions remain available
- Service role access preserved for edge functions

✅ **Enhanced Security**:
- Customer PII now properly protected
- Comprehensive audit trail established
- Automatic threat detection active

## Future Development

When building features that need appointment data:

1. **Start with `appointments_safe` view** for non-PII needs
2. **Use secure functions** when masked PII data is needed
3. **Request admin review** before using unmasked PII access functions
4. **Always implement proper error handling** for access denied scenarios

## Compliance Benefits

This fix enhances compliance with:
- **GDPR Article 32**: Security of processing
- **PIPEDA**: Safeguarding personal information
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Access control requirements
- **CCPA**: Security requirements for personal information

## Testing Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Test blocked access**: Direct queries to appointments should fail
2. **Test safe access**: appointments_safe view should work normally
3. **Test audit logging**: Check data_access_audit for access logs
4. **Test alert generation**: Unauthorized access should create security alerts
