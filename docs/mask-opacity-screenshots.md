# Mask Overlay Visual Checks (December 11, 2025)

Binary screenshot artifacts cannot be included in this repository, so the prior PNG links were removed. To validate the 60% hero and 80% post-hero mask opacities, capture the six views locally and attach them to the PR description or ticket instead of committing them:

- Desktop hero (1440x900)
- Desktop post-hero (Benefits/CTA area)
- Tablet hero (834x1112)
- Tablet post-hero
- Mobile hero (390x844)
- Mobile post-hero

This keeps the repo text-only while preserving the expected opacity targets for each section.
