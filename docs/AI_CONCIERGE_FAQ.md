# AI Concierge FAQ

The Tradeline247 AI concierge is available around the clock to answer common questions, triage incidents, and route conversations to the right human expert when needed.

## Getting Started

1. Open the in-app chat widget (bottom right corner of the dashboard).
2. Select your preferred language: English, French, Spanish, or Tagalog. The concierge will auto-detect the conversation language and confirm before proceeding.
3. Ask a question, describe your issue, or request an action (e.g., "pause campaigns", "resend verification email").

## What the Concierge Can Do

- Explain billing, compliance, and campaign setup topics using the latest marketing-approved copy.
- Provide step-by-step troubleshooting from the [Support Playbooks](../SUPPORT.md) and link to deeper guides when required.
- Collect incident details (affected feature, urgency, contact info) and create a ticket without leaving chat.
- Summarize calls or SMS interactions by referencing the underlying Twilio logs.

## Transcript Emails

- A transcript is emailed to the account owner within five minutes after the conversation ends.
- Every transcript CCs support@tradeline247ai.com for archival and compliance review.
- Weekly digests are generated automatically and distributed to marketing@tradeline247ai.com and ops@tradeline247ai.com.

## Escalating to a Human

- Type `agent` at any time to alert the Tier 1 responder.
- Critical incidents are escalated immediately and page the on-call engineer.
- Unresolved conversations after three AI responses are auto-escalated to Tier 1.

## Privacy and Data Handling

- Chat data is stored in our secure support data warehouse for 18 months.
- Personally identifiable information is masked before training data is refreshed.
- Customers can request deletion of transcripts via support@tradeline247ai.com.
