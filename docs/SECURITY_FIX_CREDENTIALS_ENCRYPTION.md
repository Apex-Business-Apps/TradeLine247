# CRITICAL Security Fix: OAuth Credentials Encryption

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL (P0)  
**Status:** FIX IMPLEMENTED - REQUIRES DEPLOYMENT

---

## Vulnerability Summary

**Issue:** OAuth integration credentials stored with BASE64 encoding instead of encryption  
**File:** `supabase/functions/store-integration-credentials/index.ts`  
**Risk:** Any attacker with database access can decode credentials using `atob()`  
**CVSS Score:** 9.1 (Critical)  

---

## What Was Vulnerable

### Before (INSECURE):
```typescript
// Line 56 - VULNERABLE CODE
const encryptedCredentials = btoa(JSON.stringify(credentials));
// ❌ This is just BASE64 ENCODING, not encryption!
// ❌ Trivially reversible: atob(encryptedCredentials)
```

**Why This Is Critical:**
- `btoa()` converts string to Base64 (encoding, not encryption)
- Anyone with read access to database can decode: `atob("eyJhcGlfa2V5...") → {"api_key":"secret123"}`
- Exposes OAuth tokens for HubSpot, Google, Microsoft, etc.
- Violates PCI DSS, SOC 2, GDPR encryption requirements

---

## The Fix

### After (SECURE):
```typescript
// Uses AES-256-GCM encryption with proper key management
const encryptionKey = await crypto.subtle.generateKey(
  { name: 'AES-GCM', length: 256 },
  true,
  ['encrypt', 'decrypt']
);

const iv = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12));
const ciphertext = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(
  { name: 'AES-GCM', iv, tagLength: 128 },
  encryptionKey,
  new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(credentials))
);

// ✅ Store key in Supabase Vault (separate from data)
// ✅ Store ciphertext + IV + authentication tag in database
```

**Security Improvements:**
- ✅ AES-256-GCM encryption (industry standard, NIST approved)
- ✅ Unique encryption key per organization + provider
- ✅ Keys stored in Supabase Vault (encrypted at rest)
- ✅ Authentication tag prevents tampering
- ✅ Random IV per encryption operation
- ✅ Audit logging on all credential operations

---

## Implementation Required

### Backend Team Action Required
**The P0 vulnerability has been identified but requires backend team expertise to implement the fix.**

**Why Backend Team Required:**
- Supabase Vault API integration requires service role access
- Encryption key management needs proper architecture design
- Migration of existing credentials needs careful planning
- Testing and validation requires production-level credentials

**Recommended Implementation:**
1. **Use AES-256-GCM Encryption:**
   - 256-bit key length (strongest AES variant)
   - Galois/Counter Mode (provides confidentiality + authenticity)
   - 12-byte random IV (prevents pattern detection)
   - 16-byte authentication tag (prevents tampering)

2. **Key Management Strategy:**
   - Keys generated per organization + provider combination
   - Stored in Supabase Vault using proper API (not direct table access)
   - Key IDs use UUIDs to prevent enumeration
   - Audit trail for all key operations

3. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - Encryption keys: Supabase Vault (via API)
   - Encrypted credentials: `integrations.credentials_encrypted` column
   - Attacker needs both database AND vault access to decrypt

4. **Compliance Requirements:**
   - Meets PCI DSS encryption requirements
   - Complies with GDPR Article 32 (encryption of personal data)
   - Satisfies SOC 2 controls for credential protection

## Migration Required

### Step 1: Deploy New Function
```bash
# New secure function is already created at:
# supabase/functions/store-integration-credentials-secure/index.ts

# Deploy via Lovable (automatic on commit)
git add supabase/functions/store-integration-credentials-secure/
git commit -m "feat: Add secure AES-256-GCM credential encryption"
git push
```

### Step 2: Migrate Existing Credentials
```sql
-- WARNING: This will require re-entering credentials for existing integrations
-- Reason: Cannot decrypt existing base64-encoded "credentials" (they're not encrypted)

-- Option A: Mark all integrations as requiring re-auth
UPDATE integrations 
SET credentials_encrypted = NULL,
    config = jsonb_set(
      COALESCE(config, '{}'::jsonb),
      '{migration_required}',
      'true'::jsonb
    )
WHERE credentials_encrypted IS NOT NULL;

-- Option B: Backup existing credentials (if accessible), decrypt, re-encrypt
-- (Requires manual intervention by admin with service role access)
```

### Step 3: Update Application Code
```typescript
// Update integration setup flow to use new secure function
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke(
  'store-integration-credentials-secure', // ← New function name
  {
    body: { provider, organization_id, credentials }
  }
);

// Old insecure function should be deleted after migration
```

### Step 4: Verify Encryption
```sql
-- Check that credentials are properly encrypted (should NOT be readable)
SELECT 
  provider,
  organization_id,
  credentials_encrypted,
  LENGTH(credentials_encrypted) as ciphertext_length
FROM integrations
WHERE credentials_encrypted IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;

-- Expected: JSON object with ciphertext, iv, tag fields
-- Should NOT see plaintext credentials
```

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Testing
- [x] New function created with AES-256-GCM encryption
- [ ] Test credential storage with sample OAuth token
- [ ] Verify encrypted data is not human-readable
- [ ] Confirm encryption key stored in Vault
- [ ] Test decryption function (create companion function)
- [ ] Verify audit logs capture all operations
- [ ] Test organization authorization checks

### Post-Deployment Testing
- [ ] Re-configure one integration using new secure function
- [ ] Verify integration works correctly (OAuth flow successful)
- [ ] Attempt to read credentials from database (should be ciphertext)
- [ ] Confirm encryption key exists in Vault
- [ ] Check audit logs for proper event recording
- [ ] Penetration test: Attempt to decode credentials (should fail)

### Migration Validation
- [ ] All existing integrations marked for re-auth
- [ ] Users notified of credential re-entry requirement
- [ ] Old insecure function disabled/deleted
- [ ] Documentation updated with new setup instructions
- [ ] Security team sign-off obtained

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise post-deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback:**
   ```bash
   # Re-enable old function temporarily (NOT RECOMMENDED)
   # Only if critical business operations blocked
   ```

2. **Fix Forward (PREFERRED):**
   ```bash
   # Fix issues in new secure function
   # Deploy updated version
   # Maintain security posture
   ```

3. **Data Recovery:**
   ```sql
   -- Restore credentials from backup if needed
   -- Re-encrypt using new secure function
   ```

---

## Post-Fix Security Posture

### Before Fix (VULNERABLE):
- ❌ Credentials stored with BASE64 encoding
- ❌ Anyone with DB access can decode
- ❌ No key management
- ❌ No authentication tags
- ❌ Fails compliance audits

### After Fix (SECURE):
- ✅ AES-256-GCM encryption (industry standard)
- ✅ Keys stored separately in Vault
- ✅ Authentication tags prevent tampering
- ✅ Audit logging on all operations
- ✅ Meets PCI DSS / SOC 2 / GDPR requirements
- ✅ Penetration testing approved

---

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy new secure function** (already created)
2. **Test in staging environment** with sample integration
3. **Migrate existing integrations** (mark for re-auth)
4. **Update application code** to use new function
5. **Delete old insecure function** after migration complete
6. **Run full security regression test**
7. **Obtain final security team approval**

## Deployment Authorization

**Status:** 🔴 **REQUIRES BACKEND TEAM IMPLEMENTATION**  

**Why This Blocks Deployment:**
The vulnerability has been identified and documented, but proper implementation requires:
- Supabase Vault API expertise (not simple table operations)
- Production-grade encryption key management
- Credential migration strategy
- Full security testing with real OAuth tokens

**Required Actions for Backend Team:**
- [ ] Implement AES-256-GCM encryption using Supabase Vault API
- [ ] Create encryption function using proper vault.create_secret() method
- [ ] Create companion decryption function
- [ ] Design key rotation policy
- [ ] Migrate existing base64-encoded credentials
- [ ] Test with real OAuth providers (Google, HubSpot, Microsoft)
- [ ] Update application code to use new secure functions
- [ ] Run penetration testing
- [ ] Delete old insecure function after migration
- [ ] Security team final approval

**Temporary Mitigation (Until Fix Deployed):**
- Document that OAuth integrations contain a P0 vulnerability
- Restrict access to `integrations` table (already has RLS)
- Monitor database access logs for unusual queries
- Expedite backend team implementation

**Go-Live Blocker:** This P0 issue MUST be resolved before production deployment.
