## Manual Verification Checklist

### App Store Connect Verification
- [ ] Navigate to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) → My Apps → TradeLine 24/7
- [ ] Go to **TestFlight** tab
- [ ] Verify build appears under **iOS Builds** section
- [ ] Confirm build status: **Ready to Test** or **Processing** (not "Waiting for Review")
- [ ] Verify build number: **219** (version 1.0.5)
- [ ] Check build metadata matches commit `1e156221`

### Internal Testing Group Setup (One-Time)
- [ ] In TestFlight → **Internal Testing**, verify "Internal Testers" group exists
- [ ] If group doesn't exist, create it:
  - [ ] Click **+** to create new group
  - [ ] Name: **Internal Testers**
  - [ ] Click **Create**
- [ ] Add internal testers to group:
  - [ ] Click **Add Testers** or **+** button
  - [ ] Select App Store Connect users (App Manager or Admin role)
  - [ ] Click **Add**
- [ ] Add build to group:
  - [ ] Select build (version 1.0.5, build 219)
  - [ ] Click **Add to Internal Testing**
  - [ ] Select group: **Internal Testers**
  - [ ] Click **Add**

### Installation & Smoke Testing
- [ ] Internal testers receive TestFlight invitation email
- [ ] Testers install TestFlight app (if not already installed)
- [ ] Testers install TradeLine 24/7 from TestFlight
- [ ] App launches successfully on iOS device
- [ ] Core app flow works (login, dashboard, basic navigation)
- [ ] No crash on launch or during smoke test

## Risks / Notes

- **Beta Groups Disabled:** `beta_groups` is commented out in `codemagic.yaml` to prevent post-processing failures. Builds must be manually added to Internal Testing group in App Store Connect until group is created and verified.
- **Internal-Only Distribution:** Build uses `testFlightInternalTestingOnly: true` export option, ensuring no external beta review submission.
- **No External Review:** `submit_to_testflight: false` prevents automatic submission to Apple's external TestFlight review process.
- **Future Enhancement:** Once "Internal Testers" group is created and verified in App Store Connect, re-enable `beta_groups` in `codemagic.yaml` for automatic distribution.

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate:**
   - Verify build appears in App Store Connect → TestFlight
   - Create "Internal Testers" group if it doesn't exist
   - Add build to Internal Testing group manually

2. **After Group Setup:**
   - Uncomment `beta_groups` section in `codemagic.yaml`
   - Future builds will automatically distribute to Internal Testers group

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Monitor TestFlight installs and crash reports
   - Collect feedback from internal testers
   - Verify app functionality on various iOS devices
