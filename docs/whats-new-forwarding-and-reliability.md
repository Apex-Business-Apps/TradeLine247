# What's new (Forwarding & Reliability)

- **Smoother call setup:** If the phone network gets busy, we slow down and try again automatically.
- **Safer connections:** We use secure links end-to-end and ask browsers to do the same.
- **Fewer "it just failed" moments:** We improved how the browser talks to our servers, so actions succeed more often.
- **Faster troubleshooting:** We now get a heads-up when something goes wrong, so we can jump in quickly.

We made these upgrades behind the scenes. You don't need to change how you work.
