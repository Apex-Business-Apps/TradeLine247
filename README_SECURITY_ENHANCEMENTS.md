# Security Enhancements Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced security monitoring and data protection system implementation following security audit recommendations.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Support Ticket Rate Limiting
- **IP-based rate limiting**: Max 3 submissions per IP per 15 minutes
- **Email-based rate limiting**: Max 2 submissions per email per 15 minutes  
- **Automatic security logging**: All rate limit violations logged for monitoring
- **Graceful error handling**: Clear error messages to users

### 2. Enhanced Anomaly Detection
- **Support spam detection**: Alerts when 5+ unique sources hit rate limits in 1 hour
- **Distributed brute force detection**: Alerts when 3+ IPs have auth failures
- **Data export monitoring**: Alerts on users with 10+ exports in 2 hours
- **Profile enumeration detection**: Alerts on non-admins accessing 20+ profiles in 1 hour

### 3. Customer Data Segmentation
- **PII access control**: Only admins/moderators can access full customer PII
- **Enhanced profile masking**: Names masked as "J***" for non-privileged users
- **Audit logging**: All PII access attempts logged for compliance
- **Granular permissions**: Separate functions for different access levels

### 4. Automated Security Monitoring
- **Real-time alerts**: Automatic alert generation on anomalous patterns
- **Contextual logging**: Enhanced security events with IP, user agent, timestamps
- **Auto-triggering**: High-severity events automatically trigger anomaly detection
- **Monitoring endpoint**: `/internal/security/monitor` for scheduled checks

## 🔄 Recommended Scheduled Tasks

### Security Monitor Cron Job
```bash
# Run every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * curl -X POST https://your-domain/internal/security/monitor
```

### Weekly Security Review
```bash
# Every Monday at 9 AM
0 9 * * 1 curl -X POST https://your-domain/internal/security/monitor > /var/log/security-review.log
```

## 📊 Monitoring Endpoints

### Security Monitor
- **Endpoint**: `POST /internal/security/monitor`
- **Purpose**: Run anomaly detection and get security summary
- **Response**: Recent alerts count, severity breakdown

### Security Dashboard Data
```sql
-- Recent security alerts
SELECT alert_type, severity, COUNT(*) as count, MAX(created_at) as latest
FROM security_alerts 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY alert_type, severity
ORDER BY latest DESC;

-- Support ticket rate limiting stats
SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(*) as violations
FROM analytics_events 
WHERE event_type LIKE 'support_ticket_rate_limit%'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

## 🚨 Alert Types

### High Priority
- `support_ticket_spam_wave`: Multiple sources hitting rate limits
- `excessive_data_export`: Users exporting large amounts of data
- `suspicious_profile_enumeration`: Non-admins accessing many profiles

### Critical Priority  
- `distributed_brute_force`: Multiple IPs with authentication failures

## 🔧 Configuration

### Rate Limiting Settings
```javascript
// In server/routes/support.new.mjs
const RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 15 * 60 * 1000; // 15 minutes
const MAX_SUBMISSIONS_PER_IP = 3;
const MAX_SUBMISSIONS_PER_EMAIL = 2;
```

### Anomaly Detection Thresholds
```sql
-- Support spam: 5+ unique sources in 1 hour
-- Brute force: 3+ IPs with failures in 30 minutes  
-- Data export: 10+ exports per user in 2 hours
-- Profile access: 20+ profiles accessed in 1 hour
```

## 📝 Next Steps

### Manual Infrastructure Tasks
1. **PostgreSQL Upgrade**: Schedule upgrade via Supabase Dashboard
2. **Extension Review**: Evaluate extensions in public schema

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Real-time Dashboard**: Create admin interface for security alerts
2. **Email Notifications**: Send critical alerts to security team
3. **Machine Learning**: Advanced pattern detection for sophisticated attacks
4. **Compliance Reports**: Automated GDPR/PIPEDA compliance reporting

## 🔍 Verification

### Test Rate Limiting
```bash
# Test IP rate limiting (should fail after 3 attempts)
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -X POST https://your-domain/api/support \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@example.com","subject":"Test","message":"Test message"}'
done
```

### Monitor Security Events
```sql
-- Check recent security events
SELECT event_type, severity, COUNT(*) 
FROM analytics_events 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
AND event_type LIKE '%security%'
GROUP BY event_type, severity;
```
