fix(ci): resolve 2 CI/test failures - client.test.ts and performanceOptimizations.ts

ðŸ”§ Fix 1: Supabase Client Test (client.test.ts)
- Replaced Vite ?raw import with Node.js fs.readFileSync
- Vite's ?raw import doesn't work in Vitest test environment
- Added robust path resolution with multiple fallbacks
- Tests now read actual file content instead of relying on import

ðŸ”§ Fix 2: Performance Optimizations (performanceOptimizations.ts)
- Added guards for window/document access in test environment
- Functions now safely handle SSR and test environments
- prefersReducedMotion() - checks for window/document before access
- isInViewport() - safe access with try-catch
- batchUpdates() - fallback for test environment without requestAnimationFrame

âœ… Additional Improvements:
- Added ChatIcon.test.tsx for component validation
- Updated vitest.config.ts for better module resolution
- All functions now test-environment safe

ðŸ“Š Test Status:
- âœ… client.test.ts - Now uses Node.js fs (testable in CI)
- âœ… performanceOptimizations.ts - Safe for test environment
- âœ… All new components have test coverage
